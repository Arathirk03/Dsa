DUTCH NATIONAL FLAG:
initialize three pointers, l  at 0th index, m at 0th index and h at n-1.
Loop until m <= h since the region between m and h is unsorted
If arr[m] == 0, Swap arr[m] and arr[l]; Increment m and Increment l, (because we've moved a 0 to the left side)
If arr[m] == 1,Increment m, (1s are already in the correct middle zone)
If arr[m] == 2, Swap arr[m] and arr[h],Decrement h, Do not increment m, (because the swapped element at m still needs to be checked)

class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int arr[] = {1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 0};
        int n = arr.length;
        int l = 0;   
        int m = 0;     
        int h = n - 1; 
        while (m <= h) {

                int temp = arr[l];
                arr[l] = arr[m];

List, Set and Map are interfaces, all the other terms are classes.
Interface contains incomplete methods, class contains complete methods
List is ordered, which can allow duplicates, Set is unordered which won't accept duplicates. 
Maps contains key-value pairs
