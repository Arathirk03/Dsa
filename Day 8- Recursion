RECURSION
Function calls itself and itself till it meets base condition
There are two types of recursions;
i)function calling same function(itself and itself)
ii) function calling another function(itself and itself) till it meets base condtion.
If we didn't mention base condition properly we will get an exception called stack overflow.
Recursions are used to break the code

q. Write code for factorial using recursion.
   5! =120 5 * 4!
           4! = 4 * 3!
                    3! = 3 * 2!
                             2! = 2 * 1!
                                      1! = 1 * 0!
For every recursive call elements will be pushed into a stack.After reaching base condition, elements will be popped.
For our question 5,4,3,2,1 all these values will be pushed in a stack.
fact(n){
  if(n==0){
  return 1;
  }else{
  return n * fact(n-1);

fibonacci
max = Math.max(arr[i], max);
min = Math.min(arr[i], min);
if(max>arr[i]){
  return max;
else
  return arr[i]

Pass-by-value and Pass-by-reference:
In java,we don't have pointers, so we can't use references, so java is pass-by-value.

q. reverse an array using two pointers
while(i<n-1){
  swap(arr[i], arr[j]);
  i++;
  j--;
}
