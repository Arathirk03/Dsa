arr =[1,2,3]
SubArray
[1,2] and [2,3]: possible
[1,3] and [3,2]: Not possible

A subarray is a contiguous (continuous) part of an array.
The order of elements must be preserved, and they must be next to each other in the original array.
For an array of length n, the number of subarrays is n(n+1)/2


SubSet
[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]: possible
[2,1]: Not possible

A subset is any combination of elements, not necessarily contiguous.
Order doesn’t matter, and elements can be picked from anywhere in the array.
For an array of length n, the number of subsets is 2ⁿ.

str = "abc"
SubSequence
ab, bc, ac: possible
ca: Not possible

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.
Works with arrays of numbers or elements.
Order matters, and no skipping allowed.
Number of subarrays = n(n+1)/2 for an array of length n.

SubString
ab, bc: possible
ac, ca: Not possible

A substring is a contiguous part of a string.
Works with strings (characters).
Order matters, and no skipping allowed.
Number of substrings = n(n+1)/2 for a string of length n
