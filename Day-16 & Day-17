Maximum product of subarray elemnts:

In the subarray if we have even positive numbers, product will be positive.
If we have odd negative numbers, product will be negative.
In the subarray if we have atleast a zero, start your product variable with one.
If you have a negative value, the product of prefix elemnts will be positive and suffix of negative elements will be positive.

q. intialise maximum variable from

leetcode- 229, 15, 56, 1358, 422, longest repeating char, 875, 162, 1011


koko eating bananas
whatever maximum value we have, we have to check that many values(run loop from 0 to max)
initialize left pointer at zero, initialize right pointer at maximum.
get the middle value and divide array elemnts
get the cell values
add all those cell values and compare with target hours
if it is less than or equal to, eliminate right half.
change right pointer to mid -1
if the sum is greater than target, eliinate left half and change left pointer to mid +1
return left

oops
inheritance
polymorphism
encapsulation
abstraction
and to achieve, those properties the prerequirement are class objects, constructors and interface
class is a virtual entity and blueprint for objects
object:" ionstance of class.
constructor: initializing the object and in objects we can call methods which were present in the particular class by creating object for the particular class
2 types:
default constructor, parameterized constructor
for evry class, there will be default backbenchers, 

for every class ther will be unfortunate firstbenchers and 
if the constructor has some parameters we call them paramenterised constructor

inheritence: four types;
 single inheritence
